We got feedback from the client (Marti Shaw). Please make these fixes and verify them end to end.

A. Signup bug for marti@gmail.com
Marti tried signing up with marti@gmail.com and got “Authentication failed”. She was able to sign up with martishaw97@gmail.com.
1. Determine the real backend error when registering marti@gmail.com (likely already exists in users table, or a validation error).
2. Improve client side error messaging in client/src/lib/errorHandling.ts so it correctly surfaces server messages like “Email already registered” and suggests signing in instead of the generic “Authentication failed”.
3. Add a simple demo admin solution so I can get Marti unstuck immediately:
   Create a one time script file (for example scripts/resetDemoUser.ts) that deletes the user row and related user_roles for a given email, starting with marti@gmail.com.
   Print clear instructions in the terminal output on how to run it.

B. Logo size needs to be much bigger at the top
Marti says the logo at the top of the main page is tiny.
1. Find the header logo usage on the main page she sees after login (likely ClientDashboard and other page headers).
2. Increase the logo display size substantially (responsive). Example target:
   container about 80 to 96 px on mobile and 96 to 112 px on desktop
   image about 64 to 80 px on mobile and 80 to 96 px on desktop
3. Do this consistently across all page headers that show the brand mark.
Optional but preferred: create a small reusable component like client/src/components/BrandMark.tsx and replace the repeated markup.

C. Rename Work It everywhere
1. Update BottomNav label from “Work It” to “Progressive Assignments”.
2. Update the WorkIt page header title from “Work It” to “Progressive Assignments”.
3. Make sure the title wraps nicely on mobile if needed.

D. Update Community description copy
In client/src/pages/ClientDashboard.tsx, replace:
“Connect with other women in this season of life.”
with:
“Celebrate breakthroughs, navigate challenges, and build friendships that last beyond the reset.”

E. Verify what Marti sees
1. After fixes, verify a new user who signs up with marti@gmail.com can log in successfully.
2. Verify the header logo is clearly larger.
3. Verify Work It rename is visible in nav and page.
4. Verify Community description text is updated.
Provide a short checklist of what you tested and where.
